[mod-setting-description]
time-refill=How long it will take for the yield of infinite resources to get reset to the default value (in seconds). Lower values may cause lag
refill-modded-ores=Whether or not you want modded ores to be infinite
modded-yield=Choose the yield to refill to for modded resources that behave like oil (infinite resources)
refill-modded-yield=Whether or not you want modded infinite resources to be refilled (modded resources that behave like oil). However, all mods will handle their resources differently, so this will not always reset resources to the correct yield.
